sudoku
======
Work in progress. Probably doesn't even run.

This is not really about Sudoku; it's just me learning about Javascript and related technologies, e.g. Aspects, test harnesses (Jasmine), MVC, IDEs, git, Promises, etc...

There's no end goal or objective at this point - just to learn.

<p style="color:red">

<table style="background-color: red">
    <tr>
        <td>Foo</td>
    </tr>
</table>
